# Tech Stack


## What Is A Tech Stack Guide?

> **Note:** Use the **[Tech Stack Index](/)** to browse Tech Stack Apps.

Every application should have a dedicated `Tech Stack Guide` handbook page to help everyone understand how the app is used, administered, and integrated with other systems. The audience of the Tech Stack Guide is anyone who needs to use the app, extend it, work with it, or understand how it fits into the rest of the Wings Tech Stack ecosystem. Creation and maintenance of each Guide is a team effort and requires collaboration between the business system owner, technical owner, and others involved in implementation and operations.


## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
